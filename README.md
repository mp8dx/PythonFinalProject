Malaria Identification website

This website only works on local machine. After downloading malaria_Identification project folder, open the folder in pycharm and run app.py. Then a link will be provided in the console which is the localHost link with the port given by pycharm usually 5000. Then open the link on chrome or edge. You will see a website.
The model we saved in the above folder is the one which was saved after executing the ipynb file named MalariaIdentification.ipynb. The accuracy for this model was 95% using cnn model.
